(a) How to use:
Run the build.sh script explained below without any arguments. Take the resulting OVA file, import it in VirtualBox and you are ready to run the Tor gateway VM.

 
(b) build.sh:
This script creates the disk image for VirtualBox based on the OpenWRT source code and OpenWRT ImageBuilder.
It takes the following arguments:
  -) clean	cleans all temporary and downloaded files
  -) help	shows the help
If run without arguments it will create the disk image first and will then create the VirtualBox image.


(c) patches:
All files in this directory will be applied before running the OpenWRT image creation process.


(d) overlay:
At the end of the OpenWRT image creation process the content of this directory will be copied to the image directory structure and therefor add or overwrite files.


(e) TODO:
List of tasks that are known to be not implemented yet.


(f) LICENSE:
